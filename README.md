# teamqgis Quantum GIS plugin

`teamqgis` is a [Quantum GIS (QGIS)](http://www.qgis.org/) plugin used to 
support digitizing training and validation data from remote sensing imagery.
The plugin was created to support the work of the the Tropical Ecology 
Assessment and Monitoring (TEAM) Network. The [TEAM 
Network](http://www.teamnetwork.org/) is a global network of sites in tropical 
forests focused on collecting standardized real-time data measuring the 
response of tropical forests to changing climate, land cover and land use, and 
population.

`teamqgis` is based off of the 
[itembrowser](http://3nids.github.io/itembrowser/) plugin created by Denis 
Rouzaud.

A number of other software tools have also been created by TEAM. The [teamlucc 
package](http://www.azvoleff.com/teamlucc) includes a set of R scripts that 
facilitate running image classifications and accuracy assess

## Installation

The latest release version of the plugin can be installed from within QGIS from
